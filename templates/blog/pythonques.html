            <h3>1.What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python</h3>
            <p>
                Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a
                general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with
                the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads,
                exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling
                real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.
                <br>
            <h5>Benefits of using Python:</h5>
            Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-tolearn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
            program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is
            completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging
            modularity and code reuse.
            Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic
            binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application
            Development and deployment.</p>

                2. What is an Interpreted language?
            </h3>

            <p>
                An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as
                Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages.
                Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with
                no intermediary compilation step.
            </p>

            <h3>
                3. What is Scope in Python?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an
                object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects
                inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them
                where you could use their objects without any prefix.
